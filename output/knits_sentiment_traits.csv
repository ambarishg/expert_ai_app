870,25,"Strange fit, nice fabric and stitching",I ordered this in my usual size small  36b bust  5 5   around 116 lbs   but the seam around the high waist stuck out and didn t cinch in at the waist at all  rather bubbled out a bit  the tunic  flaps  laid strangely as well  like they were too small almost  the high cut sides were indeed high cut   showing the waistband of my leggings  apparently that is a new style  as i have seen a few other tops like it around  but i question whether slits that high are appropriate for actual wear outside on,2,0,1,General,Tops,Knits,0.8,,Disagreement,"['tunic', 'flap', 'waistband', 'seam', 'picnic', 'waist', 'waist', 'size', 'leggings', 'wear', 'slit', 'high', 'style', 'bust', 'usual']"

870,49,Love the design,This tunic was a surprise   the navy color and the knit material and the colorful designs on the front just accentuates the tunic  however  i agree with the previous reviewer about the high slits and it s pretty wide  better if it was a 1 4 or 1 2 inch less  fits tight on the arms and shoulders but a bit loose below the bodice   i cut the tags to wear it and found out that part of the embroidery on one of the designs had unraveled  sadly returning ,4,1,0,General,Tops,Knits,2.5,Sadness,Creativity,"['tunic', 'knit', 'material', 'pattern', 'design', 'shoulder', 'color', 'reviewer', 'slit', 'navy', 'embroidery', 'bodice', 'arm', 'surprise', 'old']"
863,41,Not as it seems..,I m always looking for pieces that would good for either layering or worn alone  this looks cute on the model  but when i received it  it s actually very flowing  i wanted more of a straight cut  doesn t work very well on my body  i m 5 3  123 lbs   34 d  it s going back ,2,0,3,General,Tops,Knits,2.5,,,"['body', 'model', 'piece', 'cute', 'fluent', 'cut', 'good']"

863,49,"Simple top, love the shape",I actually love the fit of this t  the photo of the model does make it look more of a straight fit   but i love that it has more of a flared shape  the armholes are high enough that it covers that bit of arm chub i hate  it swings out enough that it looks a little dressy and a little more special than your basic t  and it drapes nicely even over my curvy shape ,5,1,0,General,Tops,Knits,8.19,Hatred,,"['photo', 'armhole', 'mannequin', 'fit', 'sit', 'chub', 'morsel', 'arm', 'form', 'shapes', 'flared', 'dressy', 'curvy', 'special', 'high']"
